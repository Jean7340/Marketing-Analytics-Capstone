# Testing Consumer Reactions

## Overview

This notebook analyzes consumer responses to two direct-mail advertising concepts for Medicare Advantage plans. 

Rather than focusing only on which ad performs better, the goal is to understand **how consumers move from first impression to action**, and where that process breaks down.

## The Question

If two ads promote the same product:

- Which one is more likely to be opened?
- Does stronger attention translate into action?
- How do responses differ across demographic groups?

## Experiment Design

We conducted a controlled survey experiment with **1,000 respondents**:

- **Option A:** 500 respondents  
- **Option B:** 500 respondents  

Participants rated each ad on a **1–5 Likert scale**, measuring:
- Likelihood to open the mail
- Likelihood to take the next step after reading

### Statistical Approach

To ensure reliable conclusions, we applied:

- Independent-sample **t-tests** for mean comparisons  
- **Z-tests** for high-response proportions (ratings of 4 or 5)  
- Significance level: **α = 0.05**

## Key Findings

### Option A Captures Attention

Option A significantly outperforms Option B on likelihood to open:

- Higher average ratings  
- Higher proportion of top scores  
- Statistically significant differences  

**Interpretation:**  
Option A creates a stronger first impression and is more effective at capturing initial attention.

### Attention Does Not Convert

Despite Option A’s advantage at the top of the funnel:

- Both ads perform identically on next-step intention  
- No statistically significant difference in conversion-related metrics

**Interpretation:**  
There is a clear **conversion gap** between opening the ad and taking action.

## Interpretation

Option A succeeds at the top of the funnel but fails to sustain momentum.

The primary bottleneck is not awareness—it is:
- Message clarity  
- Benefit communication  
- Call-to-action effectiveness

## Recommendation

### Use Option A as the Base Creative

Option A is recommended because it:
- Shows statistically significant uplift
- Builds stronger trust and clarity at first glance
- Performs consistently across demographic segments

However, improvements are required to drive action.

## Conclusion

This project highlights a common marketing challenge:

**Winning attention is not the same as winning action.**

Option A opens the door—but stronger messaging and clearer calls-to-action are required to move consumers through it.
